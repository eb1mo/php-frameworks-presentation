# What is a Framework?

 A framework is a structured platform for building applications. It provides a predefined way to organize code, offers reusable components, and comes with built-in tools for common tasks. Frameworks emphasize "convention over configuration," simplifying development by assuming standard ways of doing things.

## How is a Framework Different from a Library?

While both frameworks and libraries provide reusable code, they have fundamental differences:

- **Inversion of Control:** 
  - **Framework:** The framework dictates the architecture of your application and calls your code as needed.
  - **Library:** You call the libraryâ€™s code when you need it.
- **Scope:** 
  - **Framework:** Provides a complete solution and structure for your application.
  - **Library:** Offers specific functionality that you can use within your own application structure.
- **Usage:** 
  - **Framework:** You build your application within the framework.
  - **Library:** You build your application and use libraries to add features.
